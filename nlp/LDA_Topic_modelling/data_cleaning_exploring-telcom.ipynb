I need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere..@united pls properly train your agents.

We want compensation &amp; his original case back!.@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money...@united frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United..@united It\\'s still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew,  7 hours from now, when the plane is already here..@united Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk!.@united   It\\'s too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight..@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive.

They have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #UnitedAirlines.@united Thanks; might want to fix this line: \"Our Customer Care team is currently responding to most inquiries within 7-10 business days.\".@united it\\'s frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental.

Way to go!.@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport.

Doesn\\'t change the fact that I\\'m very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight..@united I\\'m constantly having challenges with upgrades &amp; charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 http://t.co/xC6jQ70r7B.@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came.

Could have flown to BDL &amp; back to DC in same time. #unitedairlines.@united you have now lost my bag. Never ever flying United again #joke.@united appreciate it, but changing time by 10 min multiple times 6 hours before flight is just annoying and seems like you have 0 clue.@united Missed UA1568 connection due 2 mechanical failure UA1543 (\"uplink prob\"). I will lose ~$400 in clients Mon. How can you compensate?.@United so you jacked out my cousins trip to Portland and then Cancelled Flightled her return trip?! No more United.@united Yes I did.

Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional..@united that\\'s why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons.@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why....@united that\\'s why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate.@united also didn\\'t ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs..@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn\\'t have a gate agent once we got a gate..@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That\\'s how much they value my time??.@united checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. #AirlineSecurity.@united what the hell? Flight 746.

Is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane Ever leaving?.@united Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! http://t.co/Qf0Oc2HqeZ.@united I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad.

Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted.@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?.@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night \"as fast as they can\", you should reconsider what you think that means..@united It\\'s the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United.@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don\\'t let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead.@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach..@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck..@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life.

Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u.@united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?.@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded.@united I\\'m desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD.@united Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip..@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn\\'t that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx.@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info..@united You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!.@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars.@united will lose my bag but won\\'t give me free pretzels #frauds.@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS.@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter.@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!.@united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!.@united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??.@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold..@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic.@united love how you don\\'t give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday.

Would love to see some seriousness here..@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do.@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united.@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?.@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections.@united if you don\\'t like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?.@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?

How do i get it.@united coupled with self-service policies/cost cutting exacerbates the noted issues. (3/3).@united I appreciate the immediate offer, but suspect it is more long-term issue/not simple fix. Also, ski/bootbag policy is awkward at best.@united It isnt simple issue, generally how you set up check in/baggage policies at Logan and general unhelpfulness of employees in early AM.@United terrible illogical re-route after Cancelled Flightled connection. Then made me pay to check bag. Then lost bag. #ual.@united I already follow you. One of you 800-number agents rebooked me. Went from a 777 to an a320.

Would there have been a different procedure if I had discovered the theft sooner?.@JetBlue - I did that as soon as I realized. Will they try to figure out who is stealing from people\\'s bags? Security cameras? Anything?.@JetBlue - I did, but since I was stranded in SYR without a ride I missed the window of opportunity to have rights in this matter.

Your staff is incompetent with no answers after 2 hours.....@JetBlue is blaming @TSA for flight 584 luggage debacle!  #luggagegate.@JetBlue Yoga it is. TV service seems to be down though :-(\\nI look forward to that do much!.@JetBlue You failed. That\\'s the answer. Please don\\'t justify otherwise..@JetBlue come on! Already delayed 2+ hrs on flight 1415 as we waited for the pilot to come from Boston, now you reassign him?! Endless trip..@JetBlue When I got your alert, I immediately started looking to rebook. But we only had 11 minutes from reFlight Booking Problems to catch a flight to SRQ..@JetBlue still waiting to board and see if they will give us the exit row..@JetBlue  I shouldn\\'t have to find them, they should tell us. I\\'ve flown Jet Blue since your first month. The experience isn\\'t what it was..@JetBlue if my flight was delayed can I show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do I have to go on time?.@JetBlue I\\'m over that honestly just would like to get going on the journey..@JetBlue If that was the case, why did your alert arrive so Late Flight? Four-hour delay? Don\\'t buy it..@JetBlue our flight out no Tv. Now our flight back not seated together. B6 620. Maybe our fault still no fun..@JetBlue I don\\'t believe so. That\\'s not what the team has told us..@JetBlue also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a 5 hour international flight..@JetBlue #1691 out of JFK. no one has info &amp; no answers as to why we boarded the plane. the team is in an awkward spot &amp; everyone is cranky.@jetblue  Flight 1562 is still waiting for bags. Most of us checked in 12 hours ago. People are missing connections.  Please help!.@JetBlue Something to think about when you are dealing with PEOPLE!!!!!  Just wrong.  No excuses. Figure it out &amp; expect the unexpected.@JetBlue I understand but wish you would have announced the delay 2 hours earlier vs sitting for 2 hrs at MCO.@JetBlue what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time!.@JetBlue My wife was with our dog.  They wouldn\\'t even let her out off the plane.  My daughter was at Newburgh lives close by. So wrong.@JetBlue According to your ground staff, it hasn\\'t even been taken off the plane yet!..@JetBlue thanks for making an effort. Credit where credit is due: flight 795 delayed 5 hours instead of 8 hours. #fwiw #loweredexpectations.@JetBlue At what time?  All these passengers were sitting on a hot plane with no air and no communication for over 2 hours. Just wrong.@JetBlue flight delayed at JFK 2 hours, then 3 hours, then 8.5 hours? Now it\\'s back to 5 hours with no explanation or apology?.@JetBlue Flight 1562 had a 4 1/2 hour weather delay, but what is the 45 minute delay in getting bags to tired passengers?.@JetBlue 5hrs on Tarmac yest b4 Cancelled Flight @12am.Today 3+ hr delay. Why not send txt/email re: JFK closed &amp; saved all trip 2 sit @airport again?.@JetBlue flying out of BUF 2 BOS, missing captain... Really? Delayed til 2:00... Not happy....@jetblue, it would be nice if the app would actually inform you that a flight is delayed..@JetBlue I know, but I wanted to pass it along. Not good for the \"T5 experience\" esp for someone who flies 2-3 times a month..@JetBlue So what about the plane stuck in Newburgh won\\'t start.  It that weather reLate Flightd as well.  These passengers on plane for 10 hrs..@JetBlue thanks. Home to MSY. TSA precheck agents directing people after photo until scan beyond rude. One grabbed and pushed children..@JetBlue, your hold music sucks..@JetBlue JFK T5 north check in. 3 bag drop ladies, 1 has been checking in someone for the entire time; another doing check ins too..@JetBlue no excuse though for 3 gate changes though..@JetBlue if someone had bothered to inform us that the airport closed, that would have helped..@JetBlue get me home! Flight 2016 from buf to Bos is missing a captain!? Really!?.@JetBlue nope. This 8:45am flight is now not leaving until almost 5pm. 5! I can\\'t believe I paid money for this..@JetBlue @CookJaycook123 the only update we get is that they have no idea when we will get an update. Way to go. #hopeless.@JetBlue @Amagrino will you cover the cost of my car service waiting time?!.@JetBlue this is ridiculous we are on 1.5 hours coming up of waiting to deplane, there are are newborns on board.@JetBlue waiting at HPN on plane more than an hour since landing b/c of no gate, please get us off this plane!.@JetBlue too Late Flight. Several passengers are inebriated. You\\'re in league with big alcohol. Shame on you..@JetBlue thanks for making my vacation not worth it again...

Looks like this is the last time I fly anywhere with you..@JetBlue and have empty \"help\" desks.@JetBlue there was a closure?

Seems organizational error not weather..@JetBlue where is the \"award winning service\"?.@JetBlue really not acceptable. Just informed plane won\\'t start.

Anyone have a clue? It\\'s 36 and sunny at JFK.@JetBlue u guys have 2b kidding. No help anywhere. 5 hour delays? Still no answers.

What\\'s the real reason?.@JetBlue it\\'s been 3 hours, why have you not sent the plane from the hangar for flight 1533 at JFK? This is absolutely ridiculous..@JetBlue still sitting in plane in Newburg. This is getting #ridiculous. No way to treat #loyal customers..@JetBlue what\\'s the delay if the system isn\\'t down?.@JetBlue don\\'t think any1 rly knows what\\'s goin on. supposed 2 leave at 8:30a then 9a then 9:30a then 10a then 11a then 11:30a.

You are just being nice and blaming the weather.  Airport just wasn\\'t prepared. Investigation time..@JetBlue then this agent demanded I remove my old luggage tag, every other airport the JB agent politely handles it.@JetBlue I\\'m also a mosaic customer and fly jet blue ALOT.....@JetBlue It\\'s not so much the delays as the fact that the flight is still coming up as on time on your app. Just give us an honest estimate.@JetBlue she waved someone behind me to step forward although I explained what happened and indicated my need to make my flight.@JetBlue #489. Flight #589 is departing before we even board.@JetBlue here\\'s part: was at bag drop inserted my JetBlue cc, didn\\'t print pass. Agent standing in front of me refused to print my pass.@JetBlue That\\'s not what I heard. Weather was fine this morning. Flight 136 was circling for some time.Someone forgot to clean the runway..@JetBlue When it\\'s 30 mins past scheduled time w/ no departure in sight a flight no longer qualifies as \"on time\" #updateyourwebsite #489.@JetBlue how can your entire system go down? No IT? Really?.@JetBlue Appreciate the heads up at 10:45 that my 11am flight was delayed bc the crew is stuck in Boston #communicationFAIL #dobetterJetBlue.@JetBlue seriously? System down?

Delayed 2 hrs, circle 1 hr, divert to upstate NY, just sitting for 1 hr No communication #horrible.@jetblue all your online resources  say we\\'re on time, but clearly we are not.  This is not very information age of you....@JetBlue ..... No crew at our gate..@JetBlue why don\\'t YOU tell them to update the boards?!.@JetBlue Issue is JFK. Pilot explained once JFK reopens we can get scheduled back there, but why can\\'t we divert to LGA? Closer than ACY!.@JetBlue you want me to talk to the wall?.@JetBlue Its poor Flight management. There is   no reason why a scheduled 8:00  pm  flight to takr off At 11:00pm ..@JetBlue note the time this was taken (now at 906 am) and flight still listed as on time for 910 when I\\'m not onboard http://t.co/zvfmxnuELJ.@JetBlue why is my 910 flight listed on time when its 904AM and I\\'m not on the plane yet? http://t.co/iEG2ObcEpp.@JetBlue ok we got as far as Atlantic City due to JFK being closed.

Thanks..@JetBlue won\\'t see my money again after their poor service    should have stuck with virgin america what was i thinking trying jetblue???.@JetBlue suck and their customer services are the worst  whats the point of having a loyalty scheme that they don\\'t honor #badairline.@JetBlue how about an update on flight 475 leaving tf green delayed.@JetBlue well they said Cancelled Flight on the PA system.

Now sitting in bumper to bumper traffic in taxi to finally get home. 😒.@JetBlue a voucher.. I can\\'t believe I took this risk. Not only was the plane terribly filthy and I had 15 screaming babies in my face...@JetBlue I\\'ve spoken 2/emailed JB team and explained situation. Didnt seem to matter to anyone other than me. I guess I just expected more..@JetBlue Shocked by misbehavior and cheap comments from jet airways staff to passenger at Delhi Airport Friday boarding to Dubai. Disgusting.@JetBlue you have to service your remote controllers on my flight I watched equalizer (movie) THREE times because my remote was stuck.@JetBlue @dgruber1700  oh wow and I\\'m complaining about two hour on the run way shucks JetBlue NOT GOOD your service was better than this.@JetBlue I\\'m curious to know how do you compensate for passengers missing engagements due to a two hour wait on the tar-mat to get to a gate.@JetBlue everytime I come back to Boston it\\'s a minimum 45 min wait for bags.

Then delay flight 3 1/2 hours!.@USAirways that the flight was delayed &amp; closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad, bad service.@USAirways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate.@USAirways He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout.@USAirways nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive.

Unacceptable.@USAirways doesn\\'t seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn\\'t help #usairwaysfail.@USAirways this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous.@USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight..@USAirways the plane is moving and it\\'s no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open..@USAirways  nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn\\'t even pay..@USAirways is setting themselves up for a lawsuit.

Worse experience in my life. http://t.co/3dDQq0gQni..@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm..@USAirways 7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more!.@USAirways this response doesn\\'t correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated.@USAirways been at DCA at 5 pm still here at 3 am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience!.@USAirways it was 1838, almost 5 hours Late Flight due  to mechanical..@USAirways never flying #USAirways again.

This has been a terrible experience..@USAirways Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes.@USAirways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable..@USAirways offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!!.@USAirways that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA.@USAirways that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us.@USAirways that\\'s incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice.@USAirways the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to \"choose\" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors.@USAirways I’ll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/.@USAirways your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide. #shameonyou #usairwayssucks.@USAirways worst experience ever with you guys…see my blog tomorrow on my experience.

Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up?.@USAirways we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary..@USAirways doesn\\'t want me to get home.@USAirways They don\\'t stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight.

Flight 1137 has been awful.@USAirways that\\'s the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge..@USAirways never flying with you guys again.

You are ruining people\\'s memories! You should be ashamed!.@USAirways 1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service??.@USAirways due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!!
